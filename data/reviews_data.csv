There is never a supervisor or authoritative figure in the store to assure quality, customer satisfaction and cleanliness, or to go to if you have a discrepancy. The location is convenient for patients and their families as well as staff. ",['No Images']
Rhonda,"Lancaster, CA","Reviewed June 22, 2016",1,Well I'm always trying new things. I love Starbucks and I'm one of the ones that would always be pissed off for tooo much ice and no foam in my drinks but I would always watch them like a hawk and tell them exactly how I like it. But I went in tonight to get a new drink. I kind of knew it was a waste of time just because how much different can it really be from what they have already. So whatever I tried it and omg never again will I try something new from them again. Very disgusting. The drink was horrible. The service was awesome. I got the youth berry and the caramel one. Horrible and $5 each - waste of money. I could have gone next door and got a frozen lemonade from Wendy's for $3 and it would have tasted better.,['No Images']
Harold,"Ukiah, CA","Reviewed June 22, 2016",2,"When I order a Venti Skinny vanilla latte it is always Never full - so much foam. Even when I inform the clerk No Foam. When I receive the coffee it always has at least 1 inch or more of foam and the coffee isn't for me, it's for my wife. I quit going to Starbucks and cancel my Gold Card. The company don't seem to Care. It's all about the money.",['No Images']
Arlene,"Selangor, Other","Reviewed June 19, 2016",3,"Who doesn't know Starbucks? It's popular especially at the end of each year where they give a pamphlet to a consumer and fills it up with 18 stickers (and buy 18 coffees from them) to get a planner. Imagine that, 18 coffees! It's like you are giving them your salary because it's high priced. But I guess it's only practiced in the Philippines and not in other countries as here in Malaysia, it's not that appealing. Besides that it's quite expensive, locals here prefer their local coffee shops. You could only see foreigners as their customers, and what's more, they only have a few frappucinos. Well maybe they don't have sweet tooth as Filipinos. Even though its like that, I still like Starbucks especially its Vanilla Frapp. At least its selling here. I only buy from them a few times in a year so I still can save. Continue your work and I hope you have more frappe flavors that can be appreciated by locals.",['No Images']
James,"Centereach, NY","Reviewed June 16, 2016",1,"Last year we bought two expensive stainless steel 20 oz. coffee mugs from Starbucks and now they are rusted. I have called and e-mailed Starbucks several times and they respond with only a ten-dollar gift card. I ask that you check any stainless steel mugs you have purchased from Starbucks for rust, not healthy to drink from. We can certainly find a better way to spend the 650 plus dollars we were spending on coffee from Starbucks.",['No Images']
Valerie,"Bloomfield, NJ","Reviewed June 15, 2016",2,I went to Starbucks to buy my favorite latte as a hot beverage using my ceramic reusable mug. The line was long but moved quickly. When I received my beverage I was surprised to see the mug only partially filled. I didn't have time to ask for a replacement because I had to go to work??? I didn't drink any of it until I arrived at work and by then it had shrunk to half the size of the mug.,"['https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_80013_thumbnail.jpg', 'https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_80016_thumbnail.jpg', 'https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/starbucks_80019_thumbnail.jpg']"
Kelly,"Altamonte Springs, FL","Reviewed June 9, 2016",2,"I truly enjoy the Starbucks experience. I'm a huge coffee fan and love your atmosphere and your employees are great. However, your cups leak. I mainly stop into your store in Winter Park, FL on my way to my office in the mornings. When I do stop in I'm dressed for work. Inevitably your cups leak around the lid. I've smartened up and now hold a napkin up under the lip of the lid but honestly, as much as we pay for a regular cup of Joe we shouldn't have to worry about the lid leaking on our work clothes.

Kim,"Vancouver, WA","Reviewed June 1, 2016",1,"Over the past couple of years, I've noticed several things. First, the shots of espresso are not full anymore. Second, the cups are not full anymore. Third, consistency is not the same throughout all stores. These are reason enough to go somewhere else. Let alone the company changing its free drink program so you have to spend a hefty dollar amount to get a free drink. I really think the company thinks we are all stupid!",['No Images']
chris,"Los Angeles, CA","Reviewed May 30, 2016",1,"Today is 05/29/2016. I would like to make a complaint about the 5:00 Starbucks shift on this date at this time. I was cheated out of my change (money) on this day by one of the workers and I was told it is a policy by the manager or supervisor named ** that I am not able to get refill with lemonade inside of my tea at this particular location on 1258 South La Brea Ave; Los Angeles, CA 90019-1628, Telephone 323-934-2408 even though I paid the $0.50 fee. I am not a new customer and whoever these workers are that worked today on this shift is not good workers. The workers are currently not being supervised if they are dancing while at work and treating clients inappropriately. No refills? Saying that is not company policy seems like an lie. Every other Starbucks I go to allow refills. Thank you. Also restroom needs to be cleaned. There was urine all over the toilet. Thank you.",['No Images']
Ray,"Rocklin, CA","Reviewed May 27, 2016",1,"Again after 2-3 weeks again went to the Starbucks close by to get a coffee. I had been there more often before but because the 2 Starbucks around me offering boiled and muddy coffee I have avoided going there. Today again I went there. I asked if it is fresh. She said ""just made it, yes it is fresh"" then had to get the last drop off the container poured in the cup and gave it to me. It was so muddy and bad taste so I threw it away. I had paid already. Her manager was there but didn't allow barista to brew fresh coffee.",['No Images']
Juan Paolo,"Quezon City, Other","Reviewed May 26, 2016",4,"On the occasions that I would find myself visiting a Starbucks, I can't help but notice how friendly the staff are to the customers. Their always nice, polite and very willing to assist in making your stay a pleasing experience. It's no wonder friends (especially those who do post graduate studies) always go back to their favorite Starbucks branch. They're even chums with the baristas. I hope they keep it up. If they do, then getting my favorite Soymilk Chai Tea Latte will always be a pleasurable and awesome experience.",['No Images']
kym,"Portand, OR","Reviewed May 22, 2016",1,I have been going to the Starbucks on SE 102nd and stark located in Portland Oregon for approx. 3 years. I normally don't write reviews but this is outrageous. And this has happened twice to me and 3 times to my coworker. The smart ass young lady who wears the headset and receives payment when you pick up your order has the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my life. I do a lot of traveling for business etc. I'm not the only one that has noticed this behavior by this particular young lady. Please send her back to customer care school for training. We placed our order Sunday 5/22/2016 approx. 1-1:30pm.,['No Images']
